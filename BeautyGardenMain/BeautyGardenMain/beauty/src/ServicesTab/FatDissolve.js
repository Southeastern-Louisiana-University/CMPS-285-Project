                <h5>A hyaluron pen is a pressurized device that inserts the filler into the skin. This procedure does not hurt at all, actually!</h5>

                <h5>Being a naturally occurring substance, the chances for any side effects are VERY rare and almost impossible. </h5>
                <h5>You will notice small pinpoint dots where the filler was inserted. These will subside in about 3 days after your procedure. </h5>
                <h5>You may use makeup to cover them in needed as well!</h5>
